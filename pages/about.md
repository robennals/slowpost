Slowpost is an Open Source project ([repo here](https://github.com/robennals/slowpost)) project. It has no revenue model, but, since it is a very minimal app, it doesn't cost much to run. If this project somehow becomes a big enough success that the costs are annoying then I might start soliciting donations to help cover the costs, but that isn't necessary right now.
