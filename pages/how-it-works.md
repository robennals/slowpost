# How Slowpost works

## Slowpost re-imagines the New Year Letter

Slowpost is a simple app that lets people know that you plan to write an annual letter, and lets people express interest in receiving it. That's it. No bells and whistles. You still send the letter by regular email using the addresses you collect.

## An Annual Letter Should be a Gift

An annual letter should be a gift, not a victory lap. Read [letter writing advice](./writing-a-good-letter.md) for tips on how to write a good annual letter.

## Setting Up Your Profile

Your profile tells people what you'll write about in your annual letter and helps them decide whether to subscribe. Add a description and profile photo to make your profile complete.

## Groups

Slowpost also lets you set up groups, to help you find the people you might want to subscribe to letters for. You can have a group for your family, or your class, or your workplace, or just a group of friends. Whatever you want.

If you create a group, anyone can sign up to ask to join it.

## Add People Directly

When you send a regular annual email it's normal to send it to the people you think will want to receive it, without waiting for them to ask you. That's okay because you are only sending an email once a year, so even if they aren't interested, they only have one email to ignore.

If you are using slowpost to manage your letter subscribers then it makes sense to include these people too, so, in addition to showing you people who have explicitly asked to receive your letter, you can also add the email addresses of other people who you think will want to receive it. Slowpost won't send them an email telling them you did this, but if they go to your profile while logged in with that same email, they will have the ability to confirm or cancel their subscription to you.


## Getting Subscribers

We recommend adding your slowpost profile link to the following locations, so that people know you have a letter than they might want to subscribe to:

* Your email signature line (configurable in most mail apps)
* Your profiles on Facebook, WhatsApp, Slack, etc

## The World's Least Addictive Social Network

You can think of Slowpost as being the world's least addictive social network:
* No likes
* No public followers
* No feed
* No ranking
* Post only once a year

## Open Source. Not for Profit. Not "Monetized".

Slowpost is [written by me, Rob Ennals](./about.md) for no other reason than than that I think that something like this needs to exist. It's [Open Source](./about.md) and will never be "monetized".
