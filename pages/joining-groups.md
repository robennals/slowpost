# Joining Groups

Groups on Slowpost help you reconnect with people you already know—classmates, former colleagues, neighbors, or others who share a common bond. When you join a group, you can see who else is part of it and easily subscribe to stay in touch through annual letters.

## Why Join a Group?

Groups help you:

- **Find people you know:** Reconnect with old friends, classmates, or colleagues by joining groups you both belong to.
- **Maintain loose ties:** Stay in touch with acquaintances without the pressure of regular social media engagement.
- **Share your profile easily:** When you join a group, other members can see your profile and subscribe if they'd like to hear from you.
- **Keep up with your communities:** See updates when people you know join groups, making it easier to reconnect.

## Types of Groups

**Public groups** are visible on member profiles and can be discovered by anyone. When you request to join, a group admin must approve your request.

**Private groups** are not visible to non-members. You can only find them through a direct shared link. Like public groups, joining requires admin approval.

The key difference: public groups appear on member profiles so others can find them, while private groups are completely hidden from non-members.

## How to Find and Join a Group

There are two main ways to find groups:

- **Through someone's profile:** When you visit a person's profile, you can see any public groups they belong to. Click on a group to learn more and join.
- **Through a shared link:** Someone might share a group link with you directly (e.g., "slowpost.org/g/stanford-2015"). Click the link to see the group and join.

Once you've found a group:
1. Click on the group to see its description and members
2. Click "Request to Join"
3. Wait for a group admin to approve your request

## Creating Your Own Group

Create a group for a real-world community of people who might want to stay in touch—your college class, current or former workplace, neighborhood, family, or any other group of people who know each other.

1. Go to [your Groups page](/groups)
2. Click "Create New Group"
3. Give your group a name and description
4. Choose whether it's public or private
5. Share the group link with people you'd like to invite

> **Examples of real-world groups:**
>
> - College class (e.g., "Stanford Class of 2015")
> - Current or former workplace (e.g., "Acme Corp," "Google 2018-2020")
> - Neighborhood or city (e.g., "Brooklyn Neighbors," "Seattle Friends")
> - Shared experience (e.g., "Peace Corps Morocco 2015," "Summer Camp 2010")
> - Family (e.g., "The Johnson Family," "College Roommates")

## Next Steps

Once you've joined or created a group, you can start [building your subscriber list](/pages/getting-subscribers.html). Look through the group members to find people you know or remember, and subscribe to their annual letters.

Make sure your [profile is complete](/pages/setting-up-your-profile.html) before joining groups so other members recognize you and know what you'll write about.
