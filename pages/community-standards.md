## Annual Post Guidelines

Your annual post is an opportunity to share a meaningful update with your community. Consider:

- **Reflection**: What were the highlights of your year?
- **Authenticity**: Share what matters to you, not what you think others want to hear
- **Connection**: How can you help your readers feel connected to your life?
- **Respect**: Remember that your subscribers have chosen to receive your update
