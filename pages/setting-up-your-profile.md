# Setting Up Your Profile

Your Slowpost profile is your introduction to potential subscribers. It tells people who you are and what they can expect from your annual letter. A complete, thoughtful profile helps attract the right subscribers—people genuinely interested in hearing from you.

## What to Include in Your Profile

Your profile description should answer one simple question: **What will you write about in your annual letter?**

Here are some things that make a great profile description:

- **What you'll share:** Will you write about your travels? Your creative projects? Family life? Professional insights? Let people know what to expect.
- **Why you're on Slowpost:** What drew you to the idea of writing once a year? What do you hope to get out of it?
- **A bit about yourself:** Where you live, what you do, or what you're passionate about—just enough to give context.
- **Keep it conversational:** Write as if you're talking to a friend. This isn't a resume or a formal bio.

> **Example profile description:**
>
> "I'm a photographer based in Portland, Oregon. Each year I'll share highlights from my travels, thoughts on the places I've visited, and a few favorite photos from the year. I love the idea of slowing down and reflecting once a year instead of constantly posting online."

## Adding a Profile Photo

A profile photo helps subscribers recognize you and makes your profile feel more personal. It doesn't need to be professional—just something that represents you.

- Use a clear photo of yourself (or something that represents you)
- Make sure it's well-lit and in focus
- Square photos work best (we'll automatically crop to a circle)
