# Example Annual Letter: Marcus Johnson

*This is a fictional example of a good annual letter that follows Slowpost's principles.*

This year has been about saying yes to things that scared me a little.

In February, I quit my job as a high school history teacher. No drama—I'd been doing it for twelve years and realized I was going through the motions. I'm now working at the local historical society, doing public programming and oral history projects. The pay is worse but I actually look forward to Mondays again.

The oral history work has been fascinating. I've been interviewing long-time residents about the neighborhood's history, and it's changed how I see the place I've lived for twenty years. If anyone has experience with archival work or grant writing for cultural projects, I'd love to pick your brain.

My daughter Zoe graduated from college in May—she's the first person in our family to finish a four-year degree. She's teaching English in South Korea for a year, which terrifies me but also makes me incredibly proud. We video call weekly and she seems to be thriving.

I joined a running club in the spring, mostly because I needed to do something other than work and watch TV. Turned out the social aspect was more important than the running. We grab coffee after Saturday runs and it's become my favorite part of the week. I'm not fast, but I'm consistent.

Books that stuck with me: "The Warmth of Other Suns" (finally read it after it sitting on my shelf for years), "Braiding Sweetgrass" by Robin Wall Kimmerer, and I've been working through Octavia Butler's entire catalog.

My brother died in October—heart attack, completely unexpected. He was only 52. I'm still processing it. We weren't particularly close as adults but his death has made me think about all the conversations we never had. I've been trying to be more intentional about staying in touch with people.

I started volunteering at the community garden down the street. I know nothing about gardening but the other volunteers have been patient with my ignorance. There's something grounding about it that I needed this year.

If you're ever in Baltimore and want to meet up for coffee, let me know. I'm usually around on weekends.
