# Example Annual Letter: Jamie Kowalski

I've been avoiding social media more this year, which means I've been worse at staying in touch. Hence this letter.

The big news: Emma and I had a baby in June! Her name is Rosa and she's delightful and exhausting in equal measure. Honestly, the whole first-time parent thing is harder than I expected but also stranger and funnier than I imagined. Nobody warns you about the truly weird parts.

I've been on parental leave for six months, which has been amazing and also made me realize how much of my identity was wrapped up in work. I'm heading back to my job at the public library next month—I missed the patrons and the weird reference questions more than I expected.

Emma's doing great, though she's deeply sleep deprived. She's been making elaborate sourdough breads at 3am when she can't sleep, which has the side effect of making our apartment smell wonderful. We're both figuring out this whole co-parenting thing as we go.

I've been reading a lot of picture books (occupational hazard + new parent) and if you have young kids, I highly recommend anything by Christian Robinson. For actual adult books, I loved "Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow"—it's about friendship and making things together, which hit differently while on leave.

We joined a parent-baby music class which is exactly as chaotic as it sounds, but it gets us out of the apartment. I've also been going to a monthly board game night that a colleague hosts, which has become my main social outlet that doesn't involve discussing diapers.

I've been thinking a lot about public institutions and why they matter—probably because I work at one and am relying heavily on them as a new parent. Libraries, parks, playgrounds, community centers. The free infrastructure of social life. I'm more grateful for them than I used to be.

My dad turned 70 in September and we had a small family gathering. He seems healthy but it's weird to think of my parents as genuinely old now.

If anyone has recommendations for things to do with a baby in Minneapolis, I'm all ears. We're at 2847 Lyndale Ave S now (moved to a bigger apartment in July).

I've been thinking about starting a little free library in front of our building but haven't gotten around to it yet. Maybe next year.
